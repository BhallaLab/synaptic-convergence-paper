## Figure 6

__Note__\
_For the below figure we chose the model published on ModelDB (https://modeldb.science/140828) for examining the effect of ectopic inputs on the selectivity of electrical sequences (Branco, Clark, and HÃ¤usser 2010). The base code from ModelDB was modified and run using the NEURON Simulator. The original channel kinetics parameters post the fix to NMDA_Mg_T initialization, and the dendrite used for testing were retained as is from ModelDB github repository (https://github.com/ModelDBRepository/140828). We tested out the effects of ectopics using the passive version of the model._

### Data generation

- Figure 6A\
  Schematic\
  _Schematic needs to be present in the directory containing the plotting file_
- Figure 6B\
  Path : synaptic-convergence-paper/simulations/codes/sequences/electrical\
  command : ```python3 main.py```\
  _Ensure that all the dependent files are present. Sequence of length 5 was chosen for this._
- Figure 6C\
  Path : synaptic-convergence-paper/simulations/codes/sequences/electrical\
  command : ```python3 main.py```\
  _The command needs to be run separately for sequences of 3, 5 and 8 inputs. Ensure that all the dependent files for each sequence length are present. Accordingly modify the synapse_loc_<sequence_length>.dat filename in the init_synapses.hoc file and the corresponding synapse_order_<sequence_length>.dat filename in init_sim.hoc. The output needs to be redirected to tempV_<sequence_length>_panelC.dat and tempM_<sequence_length>_panelC.dat files as well in init_sim.hoc._
- Figure 6D\
  Path : synaptic-convergence-paper/simulations/codes/sequences/electrical\
  command : ```python3 main.py```\
  runtime : ~50 min
  _Note that the mosinit.hoc file will need to call init_sim_ectopic.hoc instead of init_sim.hoc. This was done for a sequence of length 5. Accordingly use synapse_order_5.dat, ectopic_input_time_panelD.dat in init_sim_ectopic.hoc. Use synapse_loc_5.dat and ectopic_synapse_loc_panelD.dat in init_synapses_ectopic.hoc. Use The output needs to be redirected to tempV_panelD.dat and tempM_panelD.dat as well in init_sim_ectopic.hoc._
- Figure 6E\
  Path : synaptic-convergence-paper/simulations/codes/sequences/electrical\
  command : ```python3 main.py```\
  runtime : ~30 min in total for sequences of length 3 to 9
  _Note that the mosinit.hoc file will need to call init_sim_ectopic.hoc instead of init_sim.hoc. The command needs to be run separately for sequences of different sequence lengths. Ensure that all the dependent files for each sequence length are present. Accordingly use synapse_order_<sequence_length>.dat, ectopic_input_time_<sequence_length>.dat in init_sim_ectopic.hoc. Use synapse_loc_<sequence_length>.dat and ectopic_synapse_loc_<sequence_length>.dat in init_synapses_ectopic.hoc. Use The output needs to be redirected to tempV_<sequence_length>_panelE.dat and tempM_<sequence_length>_panelE.dat as well in init_sim_ectopic.hoc._
